= Collision =
In this tutorial you’ll learn how to use basic collision in your game.  flixel-android uses the quadtree algorithm. It has great performance and it’s simple to use.

== The code ==
There are several ways to let objects collide. The first one is very simple, take a look at the code below.

{{{
@Override
public void update()
{
	super.update();
	FlxG.collide();
}
}}}
A simple call of FlxG.collide() will let all objects on screen collide each other.

Collision with single object against multiple object(s):
{{{
Mario _player;
private FlxGroup enemies;
…
@Override
public void update()
{
	super.update();
	FlxG.collide(_player, _enemies); // collide single object against a group
	FlxG.collide(_enemies); // collide all objects against each other that are in the group.
}
}}}
You can add objects to a group and then collide to the group. For maximum performance it is recommended to bundle a lot of object together using FlxGroup.

The collision happens at the bounding box of the object.

<br>You can tweak the bounding box by tweaking the dimension and offset of the object.

== Callback ==
The last parameter in FlxG::collide is the callback. See the code below how to use it.
{{{
…
FlxG.collide(_player, _enemies, doDamage);
…
AFlxG doDamage = new AFlxG()
{
	@Override
	public void onNotifyCallback(FlxObject Object1, FlxObject Object2)
	{
		_player.hurt(1); // Object1
	}
};
}}}

== Handy variables for collision ==
  * immovable, whether an object will move/alter position after collision.
  * mass, the bounciness of the object. Only affects collisions. 
  * allowCollisions, indicates collision direction. Useful for one-way platforms.

== Overlap ==
If you only want to know whether an object hit something, but not to collide, you can use the FlxG::overlap method. It works similar to FlxG::collide.
