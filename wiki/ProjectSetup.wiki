==Using the GUI==

  # Download the latest "setup-ui" jar from the downloads page: http://code.google.com/p/flixel-android/downloads/list
  # Run the jar by double clicking on it.
  # Specify your projects properties using the text fields.
  # Click "Open the generation screen".
  # Click "Launch" to start downloading the required libraries and automatically set up your projects.
  # Open Eclipse and import the generated projects into your workspace 
    # File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace 
    # Click "Browse", select the folder containing the generated projects. 
    # Make sure all the projects are checked, then click "Finish"
